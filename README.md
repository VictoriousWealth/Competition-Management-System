Developed a Java-based competition management system simulating team matchups and tracking historical results. Demonstrated expertise in object-oriented programming, file handling, and modular design. Key features include:

Competition Simulation:
Structured matchups between seeded teams using round-based eliminations.
Tracked team wins and dynamically updated historical data based on match results.
Historical Data Management:
Implemented data persistence for competition history using CSV files.
Designed functionality to initialize, update, and archive historical records for all participating teams.
Dynamic Team Management:
Integrated enum classes for teams and players, ensuring cohesive relationships between players and their respective teams.
Enabled custom ranking of teams based on historical performance using a sorting algorithm.
Interactive Gameplay:
Incorporated user input for match events, such as goal scorers, validated against team rosters.
Technical Stack:
Utilized sheffield.EasyReader and EasyWriter for file I/O operations.
Applied enums and modular classes (e.g., Match, Team, Player, History) for clear code structure and maintainability.
This project highlights advanced problem-solving skills, robust file handling, and a strong foundation in Java programming.
